# NewsFinder
## Project Idea
Build an open source pipeline to help users recommend news interesting to read based on their reading history.  
## Purpose
Now we are in the big data age and information just explodes. There are roughly 2000 news incoming every 15 mins. It’s very hard for people to find the news they want to read in this situation and it’s better off to recommend articles based on people’s preference.  

## Data Source
* The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) includes news and events data from 1979 to present. 
* The size of the dataset is estimated to be ~ TB in order of magnitude.
## Technology Used
* Data Storage Layer: AWS S3
* Bash Process: Spark
* DataBase: Canssandra
